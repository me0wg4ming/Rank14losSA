# Rank14losSA Reborn

A complete rewrite of the classic Rank14losSA addon for WoW 1.12.1 with **SuperWoW** integration. This addon verbally warns you when enemies use important spells (Blind, Shield Wall, Trinket, etc.) - now with proactive GUID-based detection instead of reactive combat log parsing.

## 📜 Changelog

### v2.0 - Reborn (splitup of files)

- Pfui support
- Shows buff-fade timer on target frame now.
- always tracks cooldowns-fadeing of all enemy players in a 50yards radius.

## 🎯 What's New in Reborn

### SuperWoW Integration (Required)
- **Proactive Detection**: Uses GUID scanning and `UNIT_CASTEVENT` to detect abilities BEFORE they appear in combat log
- **50 Yard Range Check**: Only alerts for enemies within 50 yards (no more alerts from across the map)
- **Spell ID Based**: Direct spell ID detection instead of unreliable text parsing
- **Buff Scanning**: Periodically scans enemy buffs for abilities that don't trigger events

### Visual Alert Frame
- **On-Screen Alerts**: Visual notification with spell icon and text
- **Format**: `[Icon] PlayerName casts SpellName` / `[Icon] PlayerName's SpellName fades`
- **Target Priority**: Your current target's alerts always take priority over other players
- **Fully Customizable**:
  - Movable (drag to any position)
  - Adjustable background opacity (0-100%)
  - Click-through when not in edit mode
  - Position saved between sessions

### New Menu Options (`/rsa`)
- **Enabled** - Toggle addon on/off
- **Enabled outside of Battlegrounds** - Auto-enable in BGs only
- **Show Alert Frame** - Toggle visual alerts
- **Move Alert Frame** - Enter drag mode to reposition
- **Background Opacity Slider** - 0% (transparent) to 100% (visible)

### Additional Improvements
- **Barkskin (Feral)** support for Turtle WoW (Spell IDs 51401, 51451, 51452)
- **Flash Bomb** detection added
- **MP3 audio format** (smaller file sizes)
- **Movable config windows** - Both menu frames can be dragged
- **Performance optimized** - Cached functions, efficient lookups
- **Memory leak fixes** - Proper cleanup and event handling

## 📋 Requirements

- **SuperWoW** - https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW
  - This addon will NOT function without SuperWoW
  - Provides GUID scanning, `UNIT_CASTEVENT`, and `UnitXP` distance functions
